# Vanilla-Normals-Renewed
A shaders compatible minecraft texturepack, based on vanilla but with normals and specular highlights.
This version (renewed) is made for PBR, but still a WORK IN PROGRESS, so you may encounter some textures with strange behavior.

## Description

I did'nt want any of those fancy high-resolution texturepacks in order to enjoy normal mapping and specular highlights.
So i decided to make my own, but based on vanilla textures.

I release this texturepack to the public, because everyone should be able to enjoy it.

This readme is not yet finished, i'll add some screenshots.

If you want, here is a video i made a long time ago to show what it looked like (in french) https://youtu.be/ierYnCBnozg
