# Vanilla-Normals-Renewed
A shaders compatible minecraft texturepack, based on vanilla but with normals and specular highlights.
This version (renewed) is made for PBR, but still a WORK IN PROGRESS, so you may encounter some textures with strange behavior.

## Description

I did'nt want any of those fancy high-resolution texturepacks in order to enjoy normal mapping and specular highlights.
So i decided to make my own, but based on vanilla textures.

I release this texturepack to the public, because everyone should be able to enjoy it.

This readme is not yet finished, i'll add some screenshots, and detailed instructions on how to install.

If you want, here is a video i made a long time ago to show what it looked like (in french) https://youtu.be/ierYnCBnozg

## Known Bugs (on SEUS renewed 1.00)
- Double doors do not correctly take into account direction of light
- Reflective materials are sometimes too dark depending on direction of surface (Partially fixed)
- Parralax of the top of quartz billars behaves strangely
- ???
